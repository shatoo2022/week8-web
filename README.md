# PixelCraft - Digital Agency Website

A modern and responsive single-page website template for a digital agency, built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a template for a digital agency called "PixelCraft". It features a clean and modern design, with smooth animations and a single-page application (SPA) feel. Content for different pages like "About Us" and "Contact Us" is loaded dynamically without requiring a full page reload.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Loading**: The header, footer, and page content are loaded dynamically from separate HTML files using JavaScript's `fetch` API.

- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle fade-in animations on scroll for a better user experience.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean and modern design following current web trends.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the application. It contains the basic structure and placeholders for dynamic content.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styles for the website, including a CSS reset, variables, utility classes, and responsive media queries.
- `script.js`: The core JavaScript file that handles dynamic content loading, navigation, and other interactive features.
- `header.html`: An HTML fragment for the site's header and navigation bar.
- `footer.html`: An HTML fragment for the site's footer.
